# Synthesizing_Office_Floor_Plans_Using_Generative_Adversarial_Networks - Volunteer Deep Learning Engineer

Tested different types of GANs models to determine which one best can produce new architectural business building floorplans using a set of
black-and-white floorplan image files. GANs pix-2-pix model was determined to be best suited for this project. The programming model was adjusted 
as-needed until the program ran smoothly. More fine-tuning is still needed to improve the GANs synthetic results.
